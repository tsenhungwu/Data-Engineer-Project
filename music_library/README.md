# Project Introduction
On a music streaming platform such as an app or a website, data have been transferred among different activities.
To fully utilize the data and perform profound analysis on users' activities, it's extremely critical to design an architect or a data pipeline in an efficient way such that following analysis can be completed accordingly and iteratively.

The analytics team might be particularly interested in answering the following business questions: 
  - What types of songs and artists users are listening to?
  - When is the most frequent time users are logging into the app?
  - How long have users stayed on the app for each logging activity? 
  
Data resided in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

# Project Objective

Project Description
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
